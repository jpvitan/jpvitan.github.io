<p>The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm or simply the "RSA" is a asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that is widely used today to secure data. It is usually paired with another cryptographic algorithm since RSA is known to be slow and expensive.</p>
<p>This post will cover everything from number theory to its implementation in Python. The math involved isn't too hard but will require you to at least understand a bit of algebra and prime numbers.</p>
<div class="header">Generating the Public Key and Private Key</div>
<p>RSA is an "asymmetric" cryptographic algorithm, which means that the keys used for encryption is not the same that is used for decryption. In this context, we use the public key to encrypt the data and the private key to decrypt it.</p>
<p>The values of the public key and private key rely on two large prime numbers which we would denote as:</p>
$$p,q \in primes$$
